## Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
###  Project Overview

This project applies **unsupervised learning** techniques to perform **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their behavioral or demographic features, in order to better understand patterns and similarities within the dataset.

This work is intended as a **practical exploration of clustering methods in Machine Learning**.

---

### Objectives
- Understand and apply K-Means clustering
- Explore and preprocess customer data
- Determine the optimal number of clusters
- Interpret and visualize customer segments

---

### Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related features such as:
- Income or purchasing power
- Other numerical attributes relevant for segmentation

*(The dataset is assumed to be numerical and suitable for clustering.)*

---

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature selection
   - Scaling using StandardScaler

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Distribution analysis
   - Correlation insights

3. **Modeling**
   - K-Means clustering
   - Elbow Method to determine optimal `k`

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Cluster visualization
   - Interpretation of customer segments

---

### Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### Results
The model successfully groups customers into distinct clusters, revealing:
- Different spending behaviors
- Clear separations between customer profiles

These insights can be useful for **marketing strategies**, **customer targeting**, or **business decision-making**.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

- Open the Jupyter Notebook
- Run the cells sequentially

### Notes

- The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and clean workflow
- No external utilities or scripts are required
- All steps are fully reproducible within the notebook
